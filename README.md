# Technical Debt in Mobile Applications
This project is about to analyze the technical debt in Android applications by finding code metrics, code smells and architecture smells. For code metrics and code smells, I used Swanlytics (a software analytics Java application) with RepoDriller (for mining android repositories) and for architectural smells, I used DesigniteJava (an open-source code quality assessment tool for Java-based applications).

For the analysis, I aggregated the data by calculating mean using MS Excel, as the tools give the output in csv file format.
